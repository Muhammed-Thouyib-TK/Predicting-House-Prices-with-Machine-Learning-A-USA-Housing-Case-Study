# 🏠 Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning: A USA Housing Case Study

Turning data into decisions — a regression-based approach to predict home values using real-world housing data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can be used to predict house prices based on various socioeconomic and structural factors. Using a clean, real-world dataset, I applied **exploratory data analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **regression modeling** to understand and forecast property values.

Whether you're a real estate analyst, aspiring data scientist, or ML enthusiast — this project provides a practical and interpretable case study in **supervised learning**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and clean housing data for analysis
- Explore relationships between income, house features, and price
- Build and evaluate a predictive regression model
- Visualize feature impact and model accuracy

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:

- 🏘️ Average Area Income  
- 🏠 Average Area House Age  
- 🛏️ Average Number of Rooms  
- 🧍 Average Area Population  
- 💲 Price (Target variable)  
- 🗺️ Address (removed for modeling)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps & Insights

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values and verified data types
- Dropped the `Address` column (non-numeric, not predictive)
- Ensured the dataset is ready for modeling

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to visualize:
  - Income vs. Price
  - Number of Rooms vs. Price
  - Population vs. Price
- Distribution plots showed price skewness and variance

### 🔥 Correlation Analysis

- Created a heatmap to examine correlations between features
- Found **income** and **room count** to be highly correlated with price

### 🤖 Model Building: Linear Regression

- Applied **LinearRegression** from Scikit-learn
- Split the dataset using `train_test_split()`
- Trained the model and predicted housing prices on test data

### 📈 Model Evaluation

- Evaluated model using:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Residual Analysis**
  - **Visualization of predicted vs actual values**
- Found the model performs well with strong linear trends

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data handling
  - `seaborn`, `matplotlib` – visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis
